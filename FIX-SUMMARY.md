# Fix Summary - Event Detection Broken

## Problem
Event detection completely stopped working - 0 events were being detected even though event modules existed and had valid detector functions.

## Root Cause
The `loadEventModule()` function was using dynamic `import()` for ALL file types including CommonJS `.js` files. When `import()` is used with file URLs (`file:///...`) for CommonJS modules in Node.js, it fails with "Cannot find module" errors even though the files exist.

This was likely introduced in a recent refactoring to support ESM modules.

## The Fix
Changed `src/detector.ts` `loadEventModule()` function to:
- Use `require()` for CommonJS files (`.js`, `.generated.js`)
- Use `import()` only for ESM files (`.mjs`) and TypeScript (`.ts`)

This maintains backward compatibility with existing CommonJS event modules while still supporting ESM modules when needed.

### Files Changed
- `src/detector.ts` - Fixed `loadEventModule()` to use appropriate loading mechanism based on file extension

## Testing
Created `test-with-real-payload.js` script that:
1. Loads actual Hasura event payload from JSON file
2. Registers plugins (ConsoleInterceptorPlugin, ObservabilityPlugin)
3. Calls `listenTo()` with the payload
4. Shows detailed results including events detected and jobs run

Test with your real payload:
```bash
node test-with-real-payload.js sample-move-payload.json
```

## Verification
Before fix:
- Events detected: 0 (all 45 events failed to load)
- Module structure: `hasDetector: false, hasHandler: false`

After fix:
- Events detected: 1 (`move.active.change` detected correctly)
- Module structure: `hasDetector: true, hasHandler: true`
- Jobs ran: 2 (`runAR`, `runDriverPay`)

## Deployment
1. ✅ Code fixed in `src/detector.ts`
2. ✅ Build completed: `npm run build`
3. ⏭️ Deploy to production
4. ⏭️ Verify with real traffic

## Related Issue
This was separate from the original observability buffer timing issue. Both issues are now fixed:
1. **Event detection** - Fixed by using `require()` for CommonJS modules
2. **Observability buffer** - Fixed by adding direct database updates when buffer is cleared
