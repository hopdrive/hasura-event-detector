# Observability System Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This project implements a comprehensive observability system for tracking database events through their entire lifecycle, from initial triggers to downstream job execution. The system provides end-to-end traceability using correlation IDs and visualizes event flows through a custom React Flow interface.

## System Architecture Overview

The observability system consists of four main components:
1. **Correlation ID Tracking System** - Traces events from database triggers through job execution
2. **Database Architecture** - Separate observability database for isolation
3. **Cloudflare Proxy with Routing Algorithms** - Intelligent event distribution
4. **React Flow UI with Grafana Integration** - Visual observability interface

## Component 1: Correlation ID Tracking System

### Objective
Implement correlation IDs to trace database events through their entire execution chain, from initial Hasura event detection through all downstream jobs and updates.

### Technical Design

**Correlation ID Format:**
- User actions: Email address format (existing behavior)
- System actions: `{system_name}.{uuid}` format
- Flexible naming convention decided at implementation time
- Likely pattern: `{event_detector}.{job}.{uuid}`

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Leverage existing `updated_by` audit column in all database tables
- Database triggers generate correlation IDs when events occur
- All subsequent job-driven updates write correlation ID to `updated_by` field
- Replace generic "system" value with traceable correlation ID

**Parsing Logic:**
- Split on dot (`.`) to extract components
- UI displays system name for readability
- Backend maintains full correlation ID for traceability

### Benefits
- Complete event chain visibility
- Reuses existing audit infrastructure
- Backward compatible with current user tracking
- Easy parsing and display logic

## Component 2: Database Architecture

### Objective
Provide isolated storage for observability data while maintaining cost efficiency and operational simplicity.

### Architecture Decision: Separate Database, Same RDS

**Selected Approach:**
- Create new database within existing RDS PostgreSQL instance
- Separate from main application database (public schema)
- Dedicated Hasura connection string and metadata configuration

**Rationale:**
- Complete logical isolation prevents accidental foreign keys
- Easy future migration if needed
- Avoids operational overhead of multiple RDS instances
- Cost-effective approach for observability workload

**Scaling Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1:** Monitor performance on shared RDS instance
2. **Phase 2:** Scale up RDS instance if resource contention occurs
3. **Phase 3:** Migrate to separate RDS instance as last resort

**Hasura Configuration:**
- New database connection in Hasura metadata
- Independent permissions and tracking rules
- Separate GraphQL schema for observability data
- Isolated from main application data access

### Performance Considerations
- Expected volume: 3-5x multiplier of current Hasura events
- Current RDS showing performance notifications but has scaling headroom
- T3 instances are deprecated - upgrade planned regardless
- Connection pool management for Lambda concurrency (Netlify functions)

## Component 3: Cloudflare Proxy with Routing Algorithms

### Objective
Implement intelligent event routing proxy using Cloudflare Edge Functions with multiple distribution algorithms.

### Technical Architecture

**Edge Function Implementation:**
- Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects for state management
- JavaScript-based algorithm implementations
- Global distribution with low-latency execution

**URL Parameter Format:**
```
?algorithm={algorithm_type}&destinations={url1,url2,url3}
```

**Supported Algorithms:**

1. **Pass-through** (Default)
   - Simple proxy forwarding to single destination
   - No state management required

2. **Broadcast**
   - Send copy of message to all specified destinations
   - Parallel execution to multiple endpoints

3. **Round-robin**
   - Distribute events evenly across destinations
   - Durable Objects maintain rotation state
   - Configurable state persistence duration

**State Management:**
- Durable Objects store round-robin counters
- Configurable persistence duration (implementation decision)
- Admin UI controls for routing configuration
- Global state synchronization across edge locations

**Configuration Management:**
- Runtime algorithm selection via URL parameters
- Administrative interface for persistence settings
- Flexible destination management

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1:** Implement pass-through algorithm (current primary use case)
2. **Phase 2:** Add broadcast and round-robin algorithms
3. **Phase 3:** Administrative configuration interface

## Component 4: React Flow UI with Grafana Integration

### Objective
Create visual observability interface showing event flows with integrated log access from Grafana.

### UI Design

**React Flow Visualization:**
- Node-based sequence diagrams showing event cascades
- Connected arrows indicating flow direction and relationships
- Each node represents a database event or downstream job
- Interactive nodes for drilling into details

**Node Interaction:**
- Click any node to fetch related logs from Grafana
- Correlation ID used as filter parameter
- Real-time log retrieval and display

**Flow Structure:**
- Root node: Original database event trigger
- Child nodes: Subsequent jobs and updates triggered by correlation ID
- Visual representation of complete event lifecycle

### Grafana Integration

**API Integration:**
- Grafana API calls filtered by correlation ID
- Authentication via API keys or service account (Grafana's requirement)
- On-demand log fetching when users interact with nodes

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation if Grafana is unavailable
- "Grafana Offline" message displayed to users
- UI remains functional without log data

**Core Label Implementation:**
- New Grafana label for correlation IDs
- Standardized across all log sources
- Enables efficient filtering and retrieval

### Database Schema Changes
- **Remove logs table** from observability database DDL
- Grafana serves as single source of truth for log data
- Eliminates data duplication and storage overhead
